# Client routing rules | 客户端分流规则

This page covers the **routing rules inside the client profile**: why they are needed, how the layers are ordered, how to add or remove domains, and how to verify that a domain really goes direct.

The server side does not route. `templates/singbox/03_route.json` sets `final` to `direct` — the node just forwards traffic out. **Every routing decision happens in the client profile** that the subscription server hands out (`profile.json` / `profile.yaml`).

---

## Why routing rules are mandatory

In **system-proxy** mode, missing rules only cost you latency: domestic sites take a detour abroad but still load.

In **TUN mode** — the default for the sing-box official apps, Karing, and Hiddify — the kernel hijacks all traffic and there is **no "global / direct" toggle: whether a flow is proxied is decided entirely by the rules**. With incomplete rules:

- Domestic services (banking apps, e-commerce, messaging) get sent overseas — slow, CAPTCHA-heavy, and some banks refuse the connection outright
- Domestic DNS is resolved abroad, so CDNs return far-away edges and everything gets slower
- Ad and tracker domains still resolve and connect, burning node bandwidth

So the profiles this project generates **ship with complete routing rules by default**. Import and go; no manual configuration required.

## The four-layer rule stack

`route.rules` rendered from `templates/singbox-client/client-single.json.tmpl` is evaluated top-down, **first match wins**:

```
Layer 0  Baseline actions
  ├─ sniff                        protocol sniffing, recover the real domain
  ├─ protocol=dns → hijack-dns    hand DNS queries to the built-in DNS module
  └─ ip_is_private → direct       LAN / private ranges bypass the proxy

Layer 1  Ad blocking
  └─ rule_set geosite-category-ads-all → reject

Layer 2  China-direct (two tiers)
  ├─ explicit domain_suffix safety net → direct   ← hand-curated, inline
  ├─ rule_set geosite-cn               → direct   ← SagerNet community set
  └─ rule_set geoip-cn                 → direct   ← SagerNet community set

Layer 3  Fallback
  ├─ udp:443 → reject             block QUIC so browsers fall back to TCP
  └─ final   → node outbound
```

### Why Layer 2 has two tiers

| | Inline safety net | `geosite-cn` rule set |
|---|---|---|
| Contents | ~60 hand-picked high-traffic suffixes | tens of thousands, community-maintained |
| Visibility | plain JSON in the profile | binary `.srs`, opaque |
| Source | this repository's template | downloaded from `raw.githubusercontent.com` |
| Failure mode | none | download failure / stale data / GitHub unreachable |

`geosite-cn` has far broader coverage, but it **depends on a successful download at first start** — and GitHub is frequently unreachable precisely before the first connection is up. An empty rule set means **every domestic site gets routed abroad**, which is the single most common cause of "it was terrible right after I imported the subscription".

The inline safety net needs no network request and sits *before* `geosite-cn`, so WeChat, Alipay, Taobao, Bilibili, and online banking stay direct even when the rule set never loaded.

> `download_detour` points at the node outbound, so the rule sets are fetched **through your own proxy** — if the node works, the rule sets arrive.

## What the safety net covers

`domain_suffix` is **suffix matching**: listing `qq.com` automatically covers `weixin.qq.com`, `music.qq.com`, and every other subdomain. Subdomains never need to be listed.

| Category | Domain suffixes |
|---|---|
| Tencent | `qq.com`, `wechat.com`, `tencent.com` |
| Alibaba | `alipay.com`, `taobao.com`, `tmall.com`, `aliyun.com`, `aliyuncs.com`, `alicdn.com` |
| ByteDance | `douyin.com`, `toutiao.com`, `ixigua.com` |
| Baidu | `baidu.com`, `baiducontent.com`, `bdstatic.com` |
| E-commerce | `jd.com`, `jdpay.com`, `pinduoduo.com` |
| Video / audio | `bilibili.com`, `biligame.com`, `iqiyi.com`, `youku.com`, `ximalaya.com`, `kuaishou.com` |
| NetEase / Sina | `163.com`, `126.com`, `sina.com.cn`, `sinaimg.cn`, `weibo.com` |
| Local services | `meituan.com`, `dianping.com`, `sankuai.com`, `ele.me`, `didiglobal.com` |
| Travel | `ctrip.com`, `12306.cn`, `qunar.com`, `mafengwo.cn`, `lianjia.com` |
| Maps | `amap.com`, `autonavi.com` |
| Workplace | `dingtalk.com`, `feishu.cn`, `larksuite.com` |
| Banking | `icbc.com.cn`, `ccb.com`, `abchina.com`, `bankofchina.com`, `bankcomm.com` |
| Community / news | `zhihu.com`, `xiaohongshu.com`, `douban.com`, `csdn.net`, `36kr.com`, `huxiu.com`, `xueqiu.com`, `zhipin.com` |
| Institutional TLDs | `gov.cn`, `edu.cn`, `org.cn`, `com.cn` |

The authoritative list lives in [`templates/singbox-client/client-single.json.tmpl`](../../templates/singbox-client/client-single.json.tmpl); a rendered sample is in [`examples/single-node/sing-box-client-config.json`](../../examples/single-node/sing-box-client-config.json).

## Adding or removing domains

**Change the template (applies to all future installs):**

```bash
# 1. Add a line to the domain_suffix array, e.g. "newplatform.com"
vim templates/singbox-client/client-single.json.tmpl

# 2. Regenerate examples and run the gates — examples/ is drift-checked in CI
make examples
make lint test
```

**Change a live server (applies to existing users immediately):**

```bash
# This is the file the subscription server hands out
vim /etc/anyreality-resi-stack/files/profile.json

# Always validate before letting clients pull it
sing-box check -c /etc/anyreality-resi-stack/files/profile.json
```

Clients pick up the change on their next subscription refresh (24h by default, controlled by the `Profile-Update-Interval` header / `UPDATE_INTERVAL_HOURS`). Hit refresh in the client to apply it now.

---

## Verifying that a domain goes direct

**Do not judge egress with a bare `curl` on a machine running a TUN client.** TUN hijacks the route and `HTTP_PROXY` intercepts on top of that, so a "success" may have exited through an entirely different proxy. The result is meaningless.

```bash
# 1. Bypass the env proxy AND pin the physical interface
curl --noproxy '*' --interface en0 -sI https://www.163.com | head -3

# 2. Read which outbound the client actually chose (set log.level to info first)
journalctl -u sing-box -f | grep 163.com              # Linux
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/sing-box.log | grep 163.com    # macOS

# 3. Confirm the proxied egress IP is your node
curl -x socks5h://127.0.0.1:2080 https://api.ipify.org
```

## Changing the defaults

| Goal | Edit |
|---|---|
| Disable ad blocking | Remove the `geosite-category-ads-all` `reject` rule |
| Allow QUIC / HTTP/3 | Remove `{"network":"udp","port":443,"action":"reject"}` |
| Proxy China traffic too (non-CN users) | Remove the three Layer 2 `direct` rules |
| Use a different domestic DNS | Change `dns-direct`'s `server` in `dns.servers` (default `223.5.5.5`) |
| Switch to TUN mode | Replace the `mixed` inbound with `tun`; prefer `"stack": "system"` — `gvisor`/`mixed` spam socket errors on some macOS clients |
| Dual-node split routing | See [Dual-node smart routing](DUAL-NODE.md) |

Always run `sing-box check -c <file>` after editing, and only publish a profile that passes.

## What changes in dual-node mode

`--with-aggregator` serves `client-dual.json.tmpl`. The layers are identical, with two extra groups inserted between Layer 2 and Layer 3:

```
Layer 2.5  Per-service egress selection
  ├─ OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Netflix domains → residential node
  ├─ Telegram / Discord domains                    → data-center node
  └─ Telegram IP ranges (91.108.x, 149.154.160.0/20) → data-center node
```

Order matters: **China-direct comes first, service selection second**, so domestic domains are never dragged abroad by a service rule. See [Dual-node smart routing](DUAL-NODE.md).
