"""Rules that are present but silently ineffective, and the layer each fix
has to live on.

`sing-box check` passes, the service is active, the log stays clean — and the
rule still does nothing. Presence tests cannot see any of that, so these
assertions target the two things that actually decide behaviour: **which layer**
a rule lives on, and **relative order**.

Cloudflare's challenge widget loads from `brunhild.challenges.cloudflare.com`,
which has had AAAA records only — no A record — for a long time (cross-checked
against 1.1.1.1 / 8.8.8.8 / 9.9.9.9). Under a global `ipv4_only` strategy it
resolves to nothing and CAPTCHA pages spin forever.

That fix must live in the **DNS section**. In TUN mode — the mode this project
recommends — the application resolves the name before it ever opens a socket,
so a route rule never gets a say: the lookup already came back empty. The route
rule is kept as well because pinning the destination to the node is cheap and
unambiguous, but the DNS exemption is the one doing the work.

        it only decides *which* resolver is used once something asks. Verified on
        sing-box 1.13.14: with the resolve rule removed a `geoip-cn` rule never
        fired for a domain request; re-adding it made the same request match.

        Cost was measured, not assumed. First contact with uncached foreign
        domains, from China through a US node, two clients running concurrently
        and alternating request order to cancel out ordering bias:
        without resolve 0.699 s, with resolve 0.681 s — 0.97x, i.e. no difference.

        trans-Pacific jitter being misread as a config difference. Do not

        In TUN mode the destination is already an IP by the time routing runs, so
